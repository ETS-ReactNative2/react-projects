# React Projects
One repo that contains a list of my React pet projects

1. ShopInventory - https://meilahn-react-example-plafaarqnx.now.sh/ - Please wait 20 - 25 seconds for app to "wake up" on its free hosting plan. This app uses authentication to log into your GitHub account, for unique data to persist with Firebase. State is updated on a parent component, passes unidirectional data flow into its child components. You can adjust inventory in your shop - Firebase passes real-time data to the store and prevents customers from entering Checkout if they have SOLD OUT items in their cart.
