One repo that contains a list of my React pet projects

1. ShopInventory - https://meilahn-react-example-plafaarqnx.now.sh/ - Please wait 20 - 25 seconds for app to "wake up" on its free hosting plan. This app uses authentication to log into your real-time Firebase data using a GitHub account, in order to persist unique data. Application state is updated on a parent component, passes unidirectional data flow into its child components. You can adjust inventory in your shop - Firebase passes real-time data to the store and prevents customers from having SOLD OUT items in their cart. There is no Checkout or Payment steps included in this demonstration.
