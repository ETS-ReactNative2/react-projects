# React Projects
One repo that contains a list of my React pet projects.

1. Basics (React 17+) - Exploring basic Class vs. Functional Components. Importing components, passing JS, dynamic classNames. No look at state management yet, static components.

2. Reactive State Management - Local Component State Communication from Child to Parent. Two-Way Binding. Difference between individual vs. multiple set-state functions. Basic intro to Hooks with "useState" and how components can become Functional with Hooks.

3. ARCHIVED. FishInventory - REACT + FIREBASE - This app uses authentication to log into your real-time Firebase data using a GitHub account, in order to persist unique data. Application state is updated on a parent component, passes unidirectional data flow into its child components. You can adjust inventory in your shop - Firebase passes real-time data to the store and prevents customers from having SOLD OUT items in their cart. There is no Checkout or Payment steps included in this demonstration.

4. ARCHIVED. React 16 Basics - Exploring basic Class vs. Functional Components. Importing components, passing JS, dynamic classNames, Props & State, Styled Components, Error Boundaries, Two-Way-Binding in JSX. Basic intro to Hooks with "useState" and how Class components can become Functional with Hooks. First look at updating Immutable State.

5. ARCHIVED. Reduxstagram - REACT + REDUX - This app requires local storage and cookies to be enabled to persist unique data. State is managed through Redux, and follows Immutable data best practices. The instagram feed is some of my colorful graphic designs from 2011.
